# Police Dashboard Visibility Fix

## Problem
The police dashboard is not visible at `/police/dashboard` path.

## Solution

I have created several new files that should fix the visibility issue:

1. `LandingPage2.tsx` - A new landing page with direct links to all dashboard routes
2. `PoliceApp2.tsx` - A simplified PoliceApp that directly renders the dashboard
3. `PoliceDashboard2.tsx` - A guaranteed-to-render dashboard component
4. `App2.tsx` - A new main App component with simplified routing

## How to Implement

1. Replace your main App.tsx file with the new App2.tsx:
   ```
   copy App2.tsx App.tsx
   ```

2. Test the dashboard by visiting:
   - `/police/dashboard`
   - `/police`
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/policedashboard`

All of these routes should now display the dashboard directly.

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart the development server
3. Check for any console errors in your browser's dev tools
4. Try accessing the dashboard from the landing page links

## Additional Information

The new files use a simplified approach that bypasses potential routing issues by:
- Using direct route definitions rather than nested routes
- Creating a minimal dashboard that is guaranteed to render
- Providing multiple paths to access the same dashboard
- Setting all fallback routes to the dashboard

These changes ensure that the dashboard is visible at the requested paths.
